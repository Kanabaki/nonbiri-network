## Description 
Nonbiri Network is a NoSQL Network API using Mongoose DB. Motivation for the project came from the desire to understand how social networks handle HTTP requests. Nonbiri Network was created to learn a NoSQL database and to get more familiar with unstructured data. If you wanted to give users the ability to interact with other users and share thoughts and reactions you can do so with this app. Things learned from the project include making more dynamic routing for CRUD operations, as well as creating schemas and models, to create the blueprints for our Mongoose collections. Mongoose subdocuments were also learned to organize our database.


## Installation
Make sure you have the node modules in your local machine using the line **npm install**. Also make sure to have a local connection to MongooseDB.
